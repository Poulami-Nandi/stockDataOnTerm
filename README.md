# stockDataOnTerm

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

I recently implemented a powerful tool that leverages Python to fetch and display real-time stock data for S&P 500 companies. This tool is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the market by presenting data in a visually appealing and organized manner using the rich library for console output.

Key Features:
Top 10 Gainers and Losers: Displays the top 10 gainers and losers in S&P 500 stocks, considering only those with a current price greater than $10.
High Trading Volume: Lists the top 10 stocks by trading volume, providing insights into market activity.
Market Capitalization: Highlights the top 10 stocks by market capitalization, showcasing the largest companies in the index.
Real-Time Updates: The data refreshes every 60 seconds, ensuring that the information is always up-to-date.
User-Friendly Layout: The tables are strategically placed in the console for easy viewing, with gainers and losers at the top and volume and market cap at the bottom.
Technical Details:
Data Source: Utilizes the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library) to fetch real-time stock data.
Data Processing: Filters and sorts the data to display the most relevant information.
Console Output: Uses the rich library to create colorful and well-organized tables, enhancing readability and user experience.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to manage any issues with data fetching.
This tool has proven to be highly effective in providing a quick and comprehensive snapshot of the market, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in stock market trends.
